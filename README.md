I am currently a student of electronic engineering, with a great experience in full stack development, mobile and automation using modern and old tools for this purpose.

I have successfully applied these skills in the work field, where I have a remarkable experience of more than two years in full stack development, in the management and control of databases, as well as hosting and the cloud.

Throughout my learning path I have had to use and learn everything that is required of me, therefore I have a great capacity of adaptability to any requirement.
